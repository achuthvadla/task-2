evaluation.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If θ * = 1, then the o j th bank is located on the frontier (or efficient). Otherwise if θ * < 1, then the o j th bank is inefficient. Model (2) is called input-oriented DEA model
where the goal is to minimize input usage while keeping the outputs at their current levels.
Similarly, we can have an output-oriented DEA model where the goal is to maximize the
output production while keeping the inputs at their current levels.</p><br>

       <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both models (2) and (3) identify the same efficient frontier, because θ * = 1 if and
only if φ * = 1. To further illustrate the DEA methodology, we consider dual program of
model (3)</p>

        <p>Let <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Image Description">Then the model (4) seeks to determine the relative efficiency
of each bank. It is clear from the model (4) that smaller value of *
o h is preferred since we
prefer larger values of yro and smaller values of xio . Therefore, model (4) tries to find a
set of weights vi and ur so that the ratio of aggregated xio to aggregated yro reaches
the minimum. Note that model (4) is solved for each bank. Therefore, model (4) does not
seek the average best performance, but the efficient or best performance achievable by
a proper set of optimized weights.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that when *
o h = 1, we have</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p>where (*) represents the optimal values in model (4). It can be seen that (5) is similar to
the regression model with α* the intercept on the y-axis. The implicit difference between
model (4) and the regression model lies in the fact that (i) model (4) deals with more than
one dependent variables ( yrj ) at the same time, and (ii) equation (5) is obtained for each
bank with a score of one. Further, (5) represents the efficient frontier. Since different units
with score of one in model (4) may not be on the same frontier, the resulting efficient
frontier is a piecewise linear one, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above discussion, we can see that DEA can be an excellent data-mining
approach with respect to extracting efficiency information from the performance data.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider three two-stage bank operations as presented in Table 1, where the first stage
has two inputs (IT investment and labor) and one output (deposit), and the second stage has
one input (deposit generated from the first stage) and one output (profit) (see, e.g., Figure
2).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying model (2) to the two stages indicates that the banks A and B in the first stage,
and bank C in the second stage are efficient. Now, if we ignore the intermediate measure of
deposit and apply model (2), the last column of Table 1 indicates that all banks are efficient.</p>
       <p>This simple numerical example indicates that the conventional DEA fails to correctly
characterize the performance of two-stage operations, since an overall DEA efficient
performance does not necessarily indicate efficient performance in individual component.
Consequently, improvement to the best practice can be distorted, i.e., the performance
improvement of one stage affects the efficiency status of the other because of the presence</p>

        <p>of intermediate measures. In the next section, we present a DEA model that can directly
evaluate the performance of two-stage operations, and set performance targets for intermediate
measures.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">THE MODEL</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the indirect impact of IT on banking performance where IT directly impacts
certain intermediate measures which in turn are transformed to realize banking performance.
Figure 2 describes the indirect impact of IT on banking performance where the
first stage use inputs xi (i =1, …, m) to produce outputs zd ( d = 1, …, D), and then these
zd are used as inputs in the second stage to produce outputs yr (r = 1, …, s). It can be
seen that zd (intermediate measures) are outputs in stage 1 and inputs in stage 2. The
first stage is viewed as an IT-related, value-added activity where deposit is generated
and then used as the input to the second stage where revenue is generated.</p><br>

        <p>Based upon Chen and Zhu (2001), we have</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;"><img src="images/image8.jpg" alt="Image Description">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">where w1 and w2 are user-specified weights reflecting the preference over the two stages’
performance, and symbol “~” represents unknown decision variables.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale of model (6) is as follows: (i) when we evaluate the impact of IT
investment on the intermediate measures, we want to minimize the input usage given the
intermediate measures. For example, given the deposits generated, our objective is to
examine whether a bank can reduce its input consumption (including IT investment)
compared to the best practice, and (ii) when we evaluate bank performance as a result of
the intermediate measures, we want to maximize the performance given the intermediate
measures. For example, given the deposits it generated, our objective is to examine
whether a bank can increase its profit. Model (6) characterizes the indirect impact of IT
on banking performance in a single linear programming problem.</p>

        <p>[Proof]: Note that *
jo λ = *
jo μ = 1, α* = β * = 1, and ~*
djo z = djo z are feasible solutions in model
(6). This completes the proof. 􀂄.</p>
      <p><b>Theorem 2</b> If α* = β * = 1, then θ * = 1 and φ * = 1, where θ * and φ * are the optimal values
to models (2) and (3), respectively.</p>
      <p>[Proof]: Suppose α* = β * = 1 in model (6). By Theorem 1, we know that *
jo λ = *
jo μ = 1, α*
= β * = 1, and ~*
djo z = djo z . Now, if θ * < 1 and φ * > 1, then this indicates that α* =
β * = 1 is not optimal in model (6). A contradiction. 􀂄</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theorem 2 indicates if α* = β * = 1, the value-chain achieves efficient performance
when the two-stage process is viewed as a whole.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If α* = 1 and β * > 1 (or α* < 1 and β * = 1), then model (6) indicates that one of the
stages can achieve 100% efficiency given a set of optimal intermediate measures. In this case,
the original DEA models (2) and (3) can be used to provide additional information.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Theorem 2, we immediately have the following result:</p>
      <p><b>Corollary</b> A bank must be a frontier point in both stages with respect to ijo α *x (i = 1,
…, m), ~*
djo z (d = 1,…, D), and rjo β * y (r = 1, …, s), where (*) represents optimal value
in model (6).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the above Corollary, model (6) yields directions for achieving the best
practice of this two-stage process. Consequently, we can study the marginal impact of
IT investment on banking performance by using returns to scale estimation discussed
in Seiford and Zhu (1999) (see Chen & Zhu, 2001, for such a study).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In model (6), the intermediate measures for a specific bank under evaluation are set as
unknown decision variables, djo z ~ . As a result, additional constraints can be imposed on the
intermediate measures. This can further help in correctly characterizing the indirect impact
of IT on banking performance.</p><br>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;">APPLICATION</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider a set of 15 banks obtained from the Functional Cost and Profit Analysis
data set collected by the Federal Reserve Bank under its Functional Cost Analysis (FCA)
program. The data for this study is based on the FCA Plus data set from 1997. Table 2
presents the data. In the first stage, we have three inputs: Transactional IT investment,
Strategic IT investment, and Labor expenses, and two outputs: number of Accounts and
number of Transactions. In the second stage, we have two outputs: Revenue and Equity.</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT investment measures are constructed using data from the following FCA
defined expense categories: Vendor Data Processing (all expenses for data processing.</p>
